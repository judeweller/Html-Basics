        <p>As a service project, I volunteered to take old jeans, and, with the help of others, create shoes for those who have none. The moment I knew that there were thousands of children whose health was declining because of the infections they were getting in their feet I knew I had to help. </p>

            <p>There are so many children around the world who unfortunately have no shoes to wear, however, this project allowed us to create these shoes so their feet could be protected. </p>
